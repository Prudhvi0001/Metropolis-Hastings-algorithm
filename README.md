# Code Breaking :

 The procedure I have followed for code breaking is , firstly I have extracted the transition probabilities from the corpus for each letter  i.e basically normalizing frequencies by count and according to the metropolis-hasting algorithm, I have randomly generated replace and rearrange tables and used those tables for decoding the encrypted text and calculated P(D) using the decrpyted text and copus's transition probabilities , which tells us how english likely is the decrypted text .Later , I have updated the the tables, each with  a 50 % chance of getting updated and now used them from decrpyting the encrypted text and then using the decrpyted text and corpus's transition probabilities , I have caluclated P(D') for modified tables. <br><br>
            If P(D') > P(D) , i'm replacing the previous tables with these modified tables. If P(D) > P(D') , then I'm updating the tables with a probability of P(D')/P(D) by randomly generating the probability values by using numpy.rondom.binomial function which randomly generates probability for 1 trial and check if it's value is less than P(D')/P(D) , if it is less then returns 1 else returns 0 .So,based on this chance I will either update or discard the new/modified tables . <br><br>
          But, unfortunately I was unable to decrypt the text correctly , I have tried many approaches such as updating only rearranging tables witha  prob of less than 0.4, updating only replace tables with a prob of  0.4 - 0.7 and for probability greater than 0.7 ,I've updated both , also tried updating both on each iteration by random shuffling rearranging tables and also by shuffling 3,4,5 mappings in
replace tables .
